	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_1">
		<text>I'm with the military, callsign "Peregrine". We've got troops stationed here to help out with maintaining the equipment. I'm also a part-time technician - if something breaks, I can repair it.</text>

	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_2">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_3">
		<text>To be honest with you, it's shit. I don't have the tools I need, all thanks to the outstanding supply of the higher-ups. The equipment the Ecologists have got here isn't really making it easy for us, and it's gonna need some higher quality modifications... Managed to get the old receiver here repaired, though it's still spouting a bunch of gibberish. Our guys kicked the bucket at the Army Warehouses a couple of years ago, and it's still transmitting their voices.</text>

	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_4">
		<text>Well, this is the Zone, you never know what'll happen. Anyway, best wishes.</text>

		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_1">
		<text>The local cook, I guess. On paper, I'm actually a field asssistant for the Ecologists here. In practice...well, it's been a few months since they sent me out, and I get the feeling I'm not going to be going anywhere any time soon. Anyway, they call me Spirit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_2">
		<text>Why don't they deploy you anymore?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_3">
		<text>Just a little misunderstanding. People around here think I'm an alcoholic. I mean, really? With the Monolith being active again, any sane man would be driven to drink while his friends are stuck up in Jupiter. I know they'll probably be fine, but I still worry. Still, if you happen to get your hands on any Nemiroff, I can hook you up with some good stuff...
		\nWhat do you say? I can offer you four 9x18 mags or two mags of 5.45 for five swigs of Nemiroff, and four mags for ten.
		\nFor ten swigs, I can share one mag of 7.62mm 7N1, or three boxes of 12x70 shot rounds, your choice.
		\nFor fifteen swigs - that's about five full bottles - AND 7000 RU, you get three mags of 7.62x54 mm PP rounds. They are quite expensive you know...
		\nAnd for twenty swigs - just under seven full bottles, I'll fetch you an entire Berill suit from the bins. Don't think I'm a scoundrel... it's not that bad, the lion's share goes to the guys. I buy retail.</text>

		<text>Stalker, you saved us! Our bunker would have met certain doom if you didn't step in to help. To show my gratitude, come to me for a free upgrade to your psy-helmet!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_start_1">
		<text>Hello, stalker. What brings you here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_query_brain_scorcher">
		<text>What can you tell me about the Brain Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_query_brain_scorcher">
		<text>Hmm, well...we still have much to learn, but I suppose it won't hurt to share what little we know with you. The Brain Scorcher seems to emit an invasive frequency that affects the mind of any who journey too close to Pripyat's center, the NPP or the wrong side of the Red Forest. The symptoms include migraines, hallucinations, tunnel vision, and without sounding unprofessional, zombification. If I had to give a scientific estimation, I'd identify the Brain Scorcher as a remote psy-transmitter, though I'd have to conduct more invasive research before fully settling on that conclusion.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_query_psi_helmet">
		<text>Professor, I need a psy-protection helmet. My task requires me to move through the Brain Scorcher's area, and without it, I won't be able to complete it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_query_psi_helmet">
		<text>I assume you understand the risk of going through these psychically volatile areas, do you?... Oh, alright, I believe you do. You wouldn't ask me about it otherwise. Well, there has been this one model we've been working on carefully, but it remains unfinished, and it lacks final calibrations. We can give you the psy-helmet right now as it is for a humble sum of 10,000 RU, but then you'd have to deal with the risk of using untested hardware! There's one more possibility, though: we can speed up the calibration progress, but that would require us to use more funds, and for you to wait. It would cost you about 17,500 RU. If you are willing to part with such a sum, we'll begin utilizing it immediately to finish our calibrations, which should take approximately two days, give or take.</text>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_psi_helmet_1_1">
		<text>I'm in a hurry. I'll take the prototype.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_psi_helmet_1_1">
		<text>If you insist. I am quite certain that your job requires your equipment to be in perfect operational condition... Oh, I nearly forgot: you can always take it back to us for a final calibration. If you feel something is wrong, head straight to us. We can't afford any losses. So, this will cost you 10,000 RU.</text>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_psi_helmet_1_2">
		<text>Here's the money. Thank you, professor.</text>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_psi_helmet_1_2">
		<text>Not at all. But I would like you to test it first. You can help us by disabling the psy-emitter in the laboratory just north of here. Let's hope it will guard your consciousness well...</text>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_psi_helmet_1_3">
		<text>I've decided to let you finish your work. Please calibrate this helmet thoroughly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_psi_helmet_1_3">
		<text>You don't know what relief this brings to me and my colleagues. Letting us finish the final calibrations will greatly minimize the risk of injury, and we really wouldn't want to feel guilty of supplying you with untested gear... So, since you've already provided financial aid to our cause, a final calibration should cost you about 8,000 RU, and you'll need to wait approximately two days.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_psi_helmet_2_1">
		<text>I hope my patience will be worth the fully calibrated version.</text>

		<text>Indeed it will be. Once we finish working on this helmet, you'll be able to wander around the Zone freely, without suffering the risk of any psy-damage, as its psy-protective potential will be maximized. So... it will be 17,500 RU.</text>

		<text>Anything interesting happening in the scientific community lately?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_1">
		<text>Our research into the Night Star artefact has helped advance protective armour. We may see some spectacular results in a few years.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_2">
		<text>There is an old hypothesis that Snorks are the next stage of human evolution. Even after procuring tissue samples, the topic is hotly debated.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_3">
		<text>We recently conducted some fascinating experiments on Bloodsuckers that...on second thought, it's probably better you don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_4">
		<text>As an intellectual, you might appreciate this - our research has discovered that the so called "eye" of the Flesh is also equipped with...olfactory receptors! Not only can they see out their eyes, but also smell out of them! Isn't that fascinating?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_5">
		<text>Have you seen the latest batch of mutant samples that were brought in? We've been transplanting as many as we can onto...voluntary assistants. We may be on the verge of starting a craze!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_6">
		<text>We've done it! We've finally managed to create the rare Pellicle artefact under laboratory conditions! It is a breakthrough truly worthy of a Nobel Prize!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_7">
		<text>Some of our colleagues have taken to eating cooked mutant meat as a way to test the effect of mutated protein on the human body. I don't know why they don't simply pay the 100 Rads a visit instead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_8">
		<text>The Urchin artefact has allowed us to make potent anti-radiation medication. Chances are you may have benefitted from our research several times already.</text>

		<text>Progress has been slow lately. All the mutant sounds outside make it difficult to concentrate.</text>

		<text>We're trying to prove that Vortex anomalies are not merely gravitational, but rather spatial and temporal in nature. If so, their artefacts could hold the key to teleportation technologies.</text>
