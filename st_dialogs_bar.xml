	<string id="barkeep_100rads_1">
		<text>Welcome to the 100 Rads bar, my little oasis in this irradiated hellhole. Thanks to Duty, this neighbourhood is among the safest in the entire Zone. You'll be safe too, as long as you behave. Stalkers from all over come here to eat, rest, talk, find information or seek work. So, what are you after? What can the old Barkeep do for you today?</text>

	<string id="information_about_stash_barmen_1">
		<text>Heh, yeah... Sometimes, when stalkers around here grab a bottle, they drunkenly slip info on their stashes. Don't know what they keep in there, but what I do know is the value. Seven thousand and it's all yours.</text>

	<string id="devushka_help_1">
		<text>...Alright. Hip now knows what she needs to do, and wanted me to tell you while she readies up; she'll be going past the Barrier to Zaton, to drop off some artefact containers for Beard, who urgently needs them to secure and finalize a lucrative deal with some artefact collectors on the outside. She also said she refuses to go on the trip without you. So are you ready?</text>

<!-- Voronin (Duty Leader) -->
	<string id="story_dolg_0">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_1">
		<text>Things are quiet with Freedom. Of course, we're keeping a close eye on them - gotta keep our guard up. Other than that, the Bandits are getting organized, but still remain more an annoyance than a true threat. The Blue Man Group to the west and northwest don't seem as interested in us as much as we are in them, but there's no way to be sure. Gathering further intel on their ops is imperative. Other groups and clans don't pose any threat, with the startling exception of the Monolith. Something's growing out there, and it can't be any good. The only consolation is that Freedom will be the first ones hit by whatever those damn fanatics are brewing next.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_2">
		<text>How's Duty doing?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_3">
		<text>Solid three out of five - not great, not terrible. What's good is the shaky stability in terms of new fighters and their influx, fresh blood is trickling in - so not everything is lost. What's bad is the loss of much of our old blood, particularly Lt Colonel Shulga and the men at Yanov Station. With everything that's going on these days, having them around would've been helpful. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_4">
		<text>How did you lose your position in Yanov?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_5">
		<text>A weak link. A treacherous quartermaster by the name of Morgan was selling our best gear to Bandits and Mercenaries! Worse, he was caught in the act by free stalkers rather than our own men. I was presented with claims as a leader. It all left the faction badly weakened for when the Monolith returned. I ordered Shulga to pull back to Rostok when I first heard the news. Evidently he's not here, and there's still debate as to whether he's MIA or AWOL.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_6">
		<text>Understood.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_ask">
		<text>What can you tell me about Duty's operations?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_1">
		<text>We often hire Free Stalkers as auxiliaries to take out minor but urgent threats that we don't have the manpower for. Petrenko will let you know what's available.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_2">
		<text>We used to safeguard Ecologists from Mercenary attacks, although it seems they have become pals these days. Although it's freed up manpower, I can't say I approve.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_3">
		<text>You might have noticed how stark and bold our armour is. While it sticks out easily during the day - when we act as a police force - it helps immeasurably when conducting our more aggressive operations at night.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_4">
		<text>We specialize in punitive operations - if an innocent is attacked, it is us who act as their avengers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_5">
		<text>Purging mutant lairs is of great interest to us. We cannot have those disgusting beasts harassing the innocent.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_6">
		<text>One of our most successful operations involved infiltrating the Army Warehouses and stealing the cache of grenade launchers there from under Freedom's nose, without a single casualty on either side. The men involved were all awarded the Silver Shield.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_bar_dolg_leader_life_7">
		<text>We are one of the main factions in the Zone. But we are not like the other factions. You see, unlike them we have got a mission. We do not seek personal gain nor are we deceived by the Zone's many strange phenomena. Duty protects the innocent, and valiantly fends off the mutant threat. We alone stand in the way of its relentless advance to consume the planet whole. We alone endeavour to remove this grave threat permanently. In the meantime, we actively oppose those stalkers who present danger as well. The bandits, who selfishly extort others, as well as Freedom, the ignorant fools who are deluded by the Zone.</text>

<!-- Mangun (Duty Mechanic) -->
	<string id="story_dolg_m_0">
		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_1">
		<text>I used to be stationed at the Agroprom Research Institute before I got a promotion. Before the Zone came into existence, I was a car mechanic. Duty noticed my skills as a handyman after I had been around for a while, so they decided to assign me as technician here. I prefer tinkering with heavy firearms and assault weapons...I hate working on snipers, especially NATO ones.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_2">
		<text>What's that smell? Didn't think Duty allowed drinking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_3">
		<text>Man, it's hard getting by without a drink. I wish I could've been at Yanov to help out when the Monolith hit, but then again I probably wouldn't be alive if I was relocated there. So many good men were lost defending that place...Huh, looks like we've gone way off topic. Anyway, don't be shy, now - show me your toys if you need 'em fixed.</text>

	<string id="talk_to_inf_trader_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_inf_trader_1">
		<text>I'm a local informant, and I can offer you all kinds of services. At the moment, I have different types of information and maps with routes to various locations. My sources are some of the most reliable in the Zone, but they'll also kill to preserve their secrecy, so don't go asking where I learn this stuff - the answer isn't pretty.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="talk_to_maps_0">
		<text>Any free info can you share about the surrounding area?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_1">
		<text>Usually info is how I make a living, but since everything's quiet anyway, I can give you a bit of an insight. On the house.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_2">
		<text>I'm all ears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_3">
		<text>Well, you're probably already familiar with everything south of here. Right now, you're in Rostok. It's completely safe if you're on good terms with Duty. East is the Truck Cemetery - like the Garbage, but much bigger, much more radioactive and much, much more dangerous. West is the Wild Territory - the parts of Rostok that Duty can't patrol regularly. That place is an absolute nightmare, and most stalkers recommend avoiding it unless you need to get to Yantar. North are the Army Warehouses, owned by Duty's "best friend", Freedom. Further north than that quickly becomes Monolith territory, defended by ruthless fanatics and brain-melting anomalous fields.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_4">
		<text>What can you tell me about the Monolith?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_5">
		<text>Allegedly, they are the guardians of an ancient alien crystal known as the "Wish Granter". The Monolith believe this crystal created the Zone, and that it will grant wishes to those it finds worthy. To this end, they'll fiercely defend it from anyone who dares step further than the northern Barrier at Army Warehouses. Of course, there are legends of people being found worthy of the Wish Granter, but it's all bullshit. There are easier ways to get rich, and you'd think by now someone would've wished for the mutants here to disappear, or for an end to disease, or even world peace - ha! But... I guess by the time you reach the Wish Granter, you don't give a shit about anyone else.  </text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_6">
		<text>Thanks for the info.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="buy_information_from_trader_0">
		<text>Got any fresh information?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="buy_information_from_trader_1">
		<text>I've got information about the swamp doctor. You know, the crazy old man with the legendary healing powers? That's what they say, at least. I can tell you the truth, for seven thousand.</text>
	</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_6">
			<text>I'm listening.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_11">
			<text>As you might know, he lives in the Great Swamp. What you might not know is why he's there. He's waiting for his old friend, Strelok. With Strelok's rumoured return, many people want to meet the Doctor, but few ever find him. It's quite easy though - look for a breach in the fence along the northwest of the swamp, and watch out for the rads and anomalies along the way. </text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_2">
			<text>Got information about some stalker who recently raided the CNPP, for ten grand.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_7">
			<text>I'm all ears.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_12">
			<text>So, before the Monolith got all angry and rose up in earnest once again, this stalker was exploring the Sarcophagus for loot and - get this - he comes across a completely unique artefact! Apparently it's a shard of the Wish Granter itself! The Monolith didn't like that though, and he was forced to leave it behind to stop pursuit. One can only wonder what it is worth...</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_3">
			<text>I have information that sheds light on Strelok's group, but only for fifteen grand.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_8">
			<text>Gimme.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_13">
			<text>Everyone knows Strelok recently managed to assemble a new team, but no one knows who they are. They're a band of uniquely skilled individuals - Stitch, Pathfinder, Rogue and Scope. A combat medic, a gifted guide, a military deserter and a top-tier sniper respectively. One can only wonder where they are now, or what they are up to.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_4">
			<text>I can reveal information about the adventures of a mysterious stalker who explored the Generators for twenty-four thousand.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_9">
			<text>Pass it.</text>
		</string>
		<string id="buy_information_from_trader_14">
			<text>Have you heard much about the Generators? Until recently, they were only considered a myth... but after Strelok's second campaign to the center of the Zone, there's no doubt they're real. There have been constant disputes about what they are, but old satellite imagery suggests some kind of weird infrastructure, in whose honor the entire area was named. Apparently, that's the place where Monolith carry out their orders and all important processes on the territory of the Zone. So, the stalker's already gone there and I think he's serious - his intervention might have a major impact on the Zone. The leaders of a few groups have already expressed their discontent regarding this information.</text>

	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_5">
		<text>I have a very special contact who is offering a huge reward for taking down ten stalkers. Fifty grand, plus sweets. Sounds like great cash for a simple list of bounties, right? Here's the interesting part: your targets just happen to be the top ten stalkers in the entire Zone. This means you could be hunting down regulars, Dutyers, Mercs or even the fucking Monolith themselves! You can see the list on your PDA if you want. This guy wants them dead, doesn't matter how.</text>

	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_63">
		<text>No thanks, I'm out of this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_7">
		<text>I asked my contact something similar. Basically, he's tired of walking dreadnoughts vaccuuming up all the loot with their fancy rifles and expensive suits. He wants to give the common man more of a chance. Anyways, the pay will be incredible, so who cares?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_8">
		<text>Fantastic! I will upload the location of your first target onto your PDA. Every time you kill one of them, you get the location of the next guy. Have fun.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_top_10_task_about_dialog_9">
		<text>Suit yourself. The offer is still there if you change your mind.</text>

	<string id="st_top_10_task_finish_dialog_1">
		<text>Splendid work, pal! Our client is very happy with your results. As promised, here's your reward. Glad you were up to it after all - even now, I can hear people talking about your deeds. The killer of legends! This is gonna shake things up a bit, hehe...</text>

		<text>Well, now I can safely say that you're a fighter, a real fighter. Now it's time for a team fight. You get to fight with two rookies - two brothers - on your side. They haven't fought yet but they're brothers, so I had to put them into a team fight. I wouldn't expect any real help from them if I were you. You're fighting an experienced team, they're contenders for the final this season. A dangerous lot. They use different weapons but one has an automatic shotgun - be very careful with him. Good luck, pal... You're gonna need it.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_man_job_15">
		<text>You've got a special fight today. Even the army has heard about you! Don't be surprised, they fight here too - there's even a general in the crowd. These guys are from the Spetsnaz or OMON. They're well armed and their armour is as good as you'd expect. Don't worry though, I ain't gonna leave you out in the rain, either. You'll get a vest used by Freedom - it's light so it won't slow you down. Go on, show them that stalkers ain't no whipping boys. Good luck!</text>

		<text>Time for you to show what you can do. Duty captured a group of bandits that had been causing problems for stalkers near Rostok. Duty took 'em at night so most of the bandits were taken alive. They were all gonna be executed anyway so I convinced Duty to give them a chance. If any of them survive, they'll go in the can outside the Zone, which is better than dying here. They're not well-armed - probably just a few pistols and sawn-offs - but there's six of them so watch yourself. Go on now!</text>

		<text>Well, you're almost in the final. Now you'll be fighting a real stalker. He's alone but he's got an assault rifle and he's inside a protective suit. Catch one burst and you're toast. There will be a surprise that I can't tell you about too... Here's my advice: be prepared, it's gonna be tough. The winner makes it through to the final. Fight to the death, go!</text>

		<text>Congratulations, you're in the final! One more to go and this one is to the death, every man for himself. There will be 4 other stalkers in the arena: all real pros in exoskeletons but it's a fair deal this time - you'll get exactly what they have. The only thing is, you don't get medkits or bandages in a fight to the death. Ready? Go prove you're the best, GO!</text>

		<text>Shoot.</text>

		<text>Never mind.</text>

	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_11">
		<text>What is this establishment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_111">
		<text>This is the arena, my little business. A place where stalkers can test their mettle and earn their fame by fighting against the horrors of the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_12">
		<text>How do you get the mutants here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_121">
		<text>We made a deal with Duty, instead of killing all the mutants they find they bring the weaker ones here in exchange for cash. Duty gets paid, the mutants get killed, and then I get paid. Everybody wins.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_13">
		<text>Where are you from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_info_131">
		<text>I am from many places. I heard about this little backwater and understood that I could earn a good little penny here. So here I am.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_0">
		<text>What are the rules?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_rules_1">
		<text>Oh, the rules are pretty simple. I invented them myself. For challenges, there's a cage, and a mutant is let inside the cage. You pay money and tell me the time you need to kill the monster. If you make it - you win, if you don't - I win.\nBut for the main course, bandits and the Zone's other degenerates captured by Duty fight in the arena for their crimes. Some are just stalkers who fancy a fight, and not actually criminals, but whoever leaves the arena in the least amount of pieces gets a sizeable reward. If they keep on winning fights, then more stalkers will come to watch, and the combatants win larger rewards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_11">
		<text>Good to see you stalker, welcome to the arena.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_21">
		<text>So, what are you waiting for? Get into the cage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_31">
		<text>Sorry, there's nothing to fight against yet. Wait for a day or two until we can catch a new mutant.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_41">
		<text>There you are! Well done! Here's your win. If you desire another fight for money then just drop in whenever.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_arena_manager_start_51">
		<text>Sorry, bro, but you lose. Come again next time if you want.</text>
