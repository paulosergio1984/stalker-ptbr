		<text>A fresh face.. Or have I seen you around before, stalker? I'm the guy around here to see if you need to buy or sell equipment. If you are seeking a source of income, I'm always in need of someone willing to do dirty work.\nI look over this camp; all stalkers are welcome here to rest as long as they stay out of trouble. I warn you, do not mess with the military, I pay good money to keep them away from this place. Stalkers should be relatively safe as long as they don't leave camp.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_2">
		<text>Hey, stalker! What do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_esc_m_trader_task_1_complete">
		<text>Business is taken care of? Good work, here is your payment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_trader_start_dialog_esc_m_trader_task_2_complete">
		<text>You have a real talent, you know that? Here is your payment. This will be good for business.</text>

	<string id="devushka_3_quest_0">
		<text>Sidorovich, here's Hip's delivery, as promised. She trusted me to bring the artefacts to you - here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_1">
		<text>Ah, just in time. Here, Hip's payment. Tell her to go see Barkeep, and soon - she's been wanting to move up in the world, and this is her chance. There is a delivery that needs to be made from the Bar to somewhere past the Barrier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_2">
		<text>Thanks. I'll let her know. Has Hip ever been past the Barrier before?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_3_quest_3">
		<text>Hip's been in the Zone for a very, very long time. Ran with Freedom, but didn't stay long after they moved into the Army Warehouses. She's been staying near the borders like a rookie ever since, wasting years away doing a whole lot of nothing. Barkeep's job will straighten her out, one way or the other. </text>

	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_ask">
		<text>What can you tell me about business around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_1">
		<text>For the winter months, lots of orders come in from the Great Land requesting pseudodog furs. If you want to help keep a sweet devushka warm this winter, rather sell the furs to me than some scientist.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_2">
		<text>Some dopes around here will pay for anything. I've had multiple requests for "Bloodsucker teeth" - yes, yes, I know - from people who believe owning one will give them good luck. Yeah, right. I'm glad to be parting those fools from their money.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_3">
		<text>Artefacts get ordered by the least expected of people. Some jewellers came in the other day looking for Stone Flowers. Well, hopefully they've made some lady happy, and hopefully she hasn't acquired a...eh...fatal glow by now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_4">
		<text>Imagine this: there's some weirdo running around here who introduced himself as my sales representative, used my reputation, and then tried to hand off second-rate stuff! Broken barrels, the armour that's falling apart, expired canned goods...
		\nOnce his customers started complaining to me, I had no choice. His ass got whacked.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_5">
		<text>An ex-Spetsnaz used to hang around here as a free stalker. Now, a stalker is a stalker, so I didn't mind him until he tried to get a gang together to overtake my smuggling operation. Luckily he just happened to die in his sleep, and thus he never managed to see his dream through.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_6">
		<text>If anyone around here wants to be a trader, and isn't part of some major faction, they need to see me, and play by my rules. I've been here since the beginning, and am damned if some upstart thinks they know better.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_7">
		<text>A fair warning: I don't waste words with those who hurt my agents. If someone roughs up someone I know, they die. It's as simple as that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_8">
		<text>I used to help handle sensitive military documents and capture exceptionally rare mutant specimens. Folks around here don't seem to have as much need for that these days though, now that everything feels so familiar to so many.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_esc_m_trader_life_9">
		<text>Well, if you want to become a stalker you come to me first. I can provide shelter, supplies, and work for all the rookies out there. There's a military outpost not far from here but we've come to an agreement, hehe, so they usually don't disturb the stalkers in here. Just don't tick them off, okay? I pay a lot of money to keep it that way. Anyway, you're here on business? Need a job? Remember, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_wolf_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello, stalker. What brings you to the village today?</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="wolf_st_1">
		<text>I'm the local boss. Many wannabe adventurers come here with wicker baskets and blankets for a picnic, thinking they're Redrick Schuhart or something, and of course the Zone swallows them whole. Friggin' nerds and hippies. My job's to make sure they don't become mutant food on their first day in this wonderful place. It ain't easy, you know? Even with Fanatic helping me teach the rookies... I've spent a good chunk of my life in the Zone. Worked with the legendary Marked One, or rather Strelok, a while back. Travelled around, even tried to leave a few times, but there was always something that would stop me: a military raid, or another emission, or a profitable job... So, here I am, still babysitting rookies.</text>
	</string>
	
<!-- Fanatic -->
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_start_dialog_1">
		<text>Hello, stalker. How are you today?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_start_dialog_esc_m_trader_task_2">
		<text>Do you need something, stalker?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_about_esc_m_trader_task_2_0">
		<text>There are bandits that need taken care of at the car park. Sidorovich said you may want to assist me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_fanat_about_esc_m_trader_task_2_1">
		<text>Yes, I'll help you. I don't want any more harm to come to any of the rookies.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanatic_st_1">
		<text>Fanatic's the name, that's what they call me. I'm basically Wolf's deputy here. I help out training the rookies for the most part. You know, they're quite a handful. Teaching them how to shoot with their shoddy guns, telling them where they can and can't go, culling the mutants, keeping army boys and bandits at bay, there's a lot to do even so close to the Zone's border. But it's enjoyable, you know, especially when they come back to you with their first artefact and that glint still in their eyes. I'm not complaining. I still remember what it was like to be a rookie myself.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanat_training_start_0">
		<text>Hey...I don't think I've seen you around here before. You seem pretty new, too. I'm the deputy leader of this village, along with Wolf. If you'd like, I can teach you some things about Zone survival, make sure you won't die to the first mutant or anomaly you encounter.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_start_1">
		<text>You know, I could actually use a little help. I'm ready to learn.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_start_2">
		<text>No thanks, I'll live and learn at my own pace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_start_3">
		<text>Excellent. First, let's teach you how to hunt mutants. There's a small herd of boars on the other side of the road nearby. Now, boars have thick skulls and tiny brains, so the best way to deal with them is shoot them in the side, or - in a perfect world - right up the butt, from a nice, safe distance. We'll take them out together, but try keep them off me - they're in heat this time of year.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanat_training_boars_death_0">
		<text>Phew, that was crazy. What now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_boars_death_1">
		<text>Well done. See if your knife's strong enough to get a few parts off of them. When you're done, let's head to the nearest anomalous zone.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_0">
		<text>Here we go, what do I need to do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_1">
		<text>So, this pit is full of gravitational anomalies. See that artefact over there? That's just a loaf of Anomalous Bread, ignore it. But also in this pit is a Jellyfish, and Jellyfishes, along with every other artefact, have both positive and negative qualities... It's quite fortunate that one is here. Now, let's talk about the equipment you should have for artefact hunting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_2">
		<text>Show me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_3">
		<text>Here, an Echo Detector. All detectors, while active, register the presence of artefacts and measure the distance to the nearest one. They're a basic requirement for finding any artefact that isn't just junk. When you hear it beeping, then you know an artefact must be nearby. The more frequent the beeps, the closer the artefact. Unfortunately, this old model can't detect all types of artefacts, but it should be fine for your attempt today. Better models have better detection range and abilities.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_4">
		<text>Not bad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_5">
		<text>Now the second tool, a Lead Container. Do you still remember the talk about artefacts and their positive and negative qualities? Just about every artefact worth carrying is radioactive these days. The Lead Container can completely seal the artefact inside, keeping you safe from its radiation, but also prevents you from using its other effects until removed. Without it, your ass would begin glowing and you'd die in less than a few hours of carrying even a single artefact. It's quite heavy, but better safe than sorry. If you actually want to use an artefact on yourself, it's best done with a more advanced container - scientists call them "Artefact Application Modules" - which will protect you from the rads without blocking its other qualities. Sidorovich sells all of this from time to time, but he usually saves the AAMs for more experienced stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_6">
		<text>Good to know. This container sure is heavy alright. What's next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_7">
		<text>Next is this bottle of Nemiroff. Like I said, almost all artefacts are radioactive these days, and even if you brought a Lead Container the anomaly field itself is still going to give you a little glow. This bottle will help you...eh...'pass' some of that glow out of your system.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_8">
		<text>Great, anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_anomaly_reached_9">
		<text>Oh yes, bolts. Never forget about these before jumping inside anomalous fields. Throw some around to find your way through the surrounding anomalies.
		\nThat's all. Let's go. I'll cover you from here on.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_artefact_taken_1">
		<text>Hey, I got the artefact!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_artefact_taken_2">
		<text>Well, well... I can see you'll be an experienced stalker one day. Let's head back to the village - we'll continue your training there.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_back_to_village_1">
		<text>That sure was something...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_back_to_village_2">
		<text>Tired? You seem to know the bare basics now, but I've got an extra challenge for when you're ready.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_stash_search_0">
		<text>I'm ready. What is this challenge?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_stash_search_1">
		<text>Tell me, what self-respecting stalker has never found another's secrets? The Zone is common to everybody here. Those who manage, eat. Sometimes, finding a stash is not just an achievement, but a necessity. I've hidden a little 'nest egg' somewhere in the village - try to find it.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_stash_found_0">
		<text>Found it... Thanks for the artefact.</text>
	</string>
	<!--string id="fanat_training_stash_found_1">
		<text>Huh... I see that with your level of perception, the Zone won't be taking you so easily. Your final lesson is about to start. Take some time to prepare.</text>
	</string-->
	<string id="fanat_training_stash_found_1">
		<text>Huh... I see that with your level of perception, the Zone won't be taking you so easily. That was your final lesson. You've certainly proven to be your own stalker, and you should be proud of it. There's nothing more I can teach you.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_start_0">
		<text>And what is our final task?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_start_1">
		<text>You'll see. As you know, the most insidious enemy of man - strangely enough - remains a man. For a long time, we've kept the vehicle station clear of all the bandits, but they keep coming back. They've been a steady threat, usually numbering from around five to seven. Let's go take care of them.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_end_0">
		<text>Hah, the two of us against these... We're heroes!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_bandit_raid_end_1">
		<text>What you just called heroism here is commonplace for more experienced stalkers. Anyway, let's head back to the village.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="fanat_training_end_0">
		<text>Thanks for taking me under your wing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="fanat_training_end_1">
		<text>Eh, it's what I do. Here, I've got some info on a route from Agroprom to Yantar in case you haven't already heard of it. Rest up for a bit, and then... Agh, who am I to tell you what to do? You've certainly proven to be your own stalker, and you should be proud of it. Now scram. Breathe in that delicious radioactive air and be free!</text>

I was a gopher at first - anti-rads, armour-piercing ammo, that sort of thing. Then I worked for Sidorovich... paying him back for saving my ass. As I pulled chestnuts out of the fire for him, I made some useful connections and branched out on my own as soon as I could to start delivering exclusive orders.

		<text>Here. This is an SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. I bought it off Mac, the legendary Freedom guard. He swore there are no others like it in the whole Zone. It's an exclusive item, at least in these parts. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_422">
		<text>Yeah. SVU2-A, a short sniper rifle with an increased rate of fire. It'll be 16,000 extra.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_431">
		<text>Sure, just look at Lynx here.  Hand-crafted by a local expert. He's deceased now, so there won't be any copies. It looks just like any other rifle, but take it out for some target practice and you'll feel all the difference. It's got a perfect combination of accuracy and stopping power. Add the remaining 16,000 and this baby's yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_432">
		<text>Yeah, Lynx - a sniper rifle with increased accuracy and power. Add 16,000 and it's yours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_511">
		<text>Look here. I managed to get everything off my list - a CS-3a with a helmet. The helmet is nothing special on its own, but it allows for installing a mobile tactical complex, which includes a high-quality night vision system and an active infrared sensor. Now, the CS-3a armour is a real beauty. Excellent protection from bullets and anomalies is a rare feature indeed in a suit as light and mobile as this one. The whole thing will cost you 32,000.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_512">

	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_611">
		<text>Specially for you, a SEVA suit. Everything just like you ordered - a closed-cycle respiratory module, thermal resistant, protective electrical circuit, and outer-surface anti corrosion materials. Plus several built-in artefact containers as a bonus. A must-have suit for any stalker. Toss in 24,000 like we agreed and it's yours.</text>

	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_get_order_711">
		<text>There it is, a combat exoskeleton as large as life. The best protection you can get in the Zone from bullets, claws or grenade fragments, with the exception of armoured vehicles. But it also takes after armoured vehicles in that it relieves your weight burden - within reason, of course. 48,000 and it's yours, warts and all... err... by that I mean batteries and servomotors.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_132">

		<text>You must have given this choice a lot of thought. I can get my hands on a combat version, but it'll cost you 60,000. Expensive, I know, but well worth it. Keep in mind I'll need 12,000 of that paid right now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="esc_2_12_stalker_nimble_place_order_172">

		<text>I'd like to ask you some questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_1_start_2">
		<text>There's not much I can tell you, unless you're looking for work. I know a guy. He's rich, but clueless. He's out there, treating the Zone like a safari right now. He doesn't care for artefacts. All he wants to do is collect old guns...and shoot pigs with said guns. Told me he wanted a scoped TOZ that has "seen some genuine Zone action" as a souvenir. Naturally, what he's willing to pay is absolutely through the roof! Problem is, I haven't seen a scoped TOZ in the Zone since 2012. Certainly, none of the major traders below the Barrier seem to stock one. But if you find one, bring it to me along with 20 rounds of buckshot and you'll be paid several times what it'd fetch you elsewhere.</text>

		<text>Thank you for letting me know. An old friend just dropped me a PDA message, saying something similar. Look, come back here tonight, alright?

		<text>I'm not so sure. The message I got earlier...it was from Lukash. He urgently needs an extra hand for a medicine run to their base in Yanov. I know what I said about Freedom earlier, but we both know it's not just them who'll benefit from that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_2">
		<text>Lukash will probably find someone else to do the run. Barkeep occupies one of the most central points in the Zone - grabbing his job while it's still available would be better for you in the long run.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_3">
		<text>In that case, we should get to Lukash to pick up the meds as soon as possible - every second could save a life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_4">
		<text>Hm, yeah, you're right. Freedom can find someone else to be their mule. Barkeep it is. Let's get going while the going is good.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_4_quest_5">
		<text>Glad you agree. From what I hear, the Freedom leader at Yanov runs a tight ship. Doing this favour for Lukash would save more lives than whatever Barkeep had in mind. Ready to head to the Warehouses when you are.</text>

	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_0">
		<text>Do you have any idea where we can find the artefacts Sidorovich wants?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_1">
		<text>Of course. Moonlights can be found in Electro anomalies, Wrenched in Vortex anomalies and Fireballs in the Burner anomalies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_2">
		<text>Alright. And I suppose I'll stand guard while you dive into them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_3">
		<text>Actually, I will stand guard. You can dive into them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_4">
		<text>Aren't you supposed to be the artefact hunter?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_artefact_5">
		<text>I told you where to find them, didn't I? Besides, it'd be more fun for you this way.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_0">
		<text>Hey, Hip? Do you know any stories?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_1">
		<text>Yeah, I do actually. Ever heard of Yuri Semetsky? He was famous for dying at least once per day on the Stalker Network. Probably just a glitch, but some say Yuri was one of the first Stalkers to ever reach the Wish Granter. Ever. Rumour was he wished for immortality. The result was him dying, only to resurrect somewhere else at random up to 24 hours or less before his next unavoidable death. Some of his obituaries were really awful. As beautiful as the Zone can be, it holds some dark things best left unexplored.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_2">
		<text>And do you know why Yuri's deaths are no longer reported on the network?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_3">
		<text>Not exactly, but I've speculated. I find it interesting that his deaths stopped reporting shortly after a Stalker named "Marked One" shut off the Brain Scorcher and reached the NPP. I have no clue what went down there, but things definitely changed. Whatever happened, it seems Yuri is now free to remain dead in peace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_4">
		<text>You don't think he could still be alive? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_about_semeckiy_5">
		<text>Maybe, but I'm not sure what sort of life that would be now. Perhaps he continues as some sort of ghost? I could not say. Stranger things have happened.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="give_devushka_medved_0">
		<text>Hey, Hip! Carry this detector for me, would you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="give_devushka_medved_1">
		<text>Just what I needed - yet another expensive machine that goes "beep".</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_give_present_0">
		<text>What happens next in the future of Hip?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_1">
		<text>You know, I've been thinking things over in my travels with you. Maybe it isn't the right time for me to settle down and start my own business yet. Thought it was what I wanted, but in truth I was just afraid. What I really want is to adventure. I realize now that there's still so much to explore.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_2">
		<text>What about following in Nimble's footsteps?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_3">
		<text>So I can do nothing but sit on a boat all day? Maybe that's how I felt before, but look at this place. How can you bear to sit inside all the time knowing what's out here? I'm not ready for the quiet life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_4">
		<text>It's mostly death out here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_5">
		<text>Yet here you are, out here, almost every day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_6">
		<text>What do you mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_7">
		<text>It's difficult to describe, but I think I can be happy here. The Zone really is a miracle, and I'd like to see more of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_8">
		<text>So you're sure you will choose the life of a field stalker over that of a trader? Even once you have the money and connections to settle down?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_9">
		<text>Yes, I'm sure. Maybe once I'm old and fat like Sidorovich I'll change my mind.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_10">
		<text>You're being rash about this. Think it over some more.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_12">
		<text>I already have. I've made my decision. I was hoping you'd be more supportive of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_11">
		<text>Alright, then maybe stick around. It'll be good to have someone watch out for bloodsuckers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_13">
		<text>Hah! I thought so myself! Here, take this as thanks. You've come through for me more times than anyone'd care to count. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_give_present_14">
		<text>Guess that's what teams do, isn't it? Let's go.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="devushka_go_village_0">
		<text>Hip, I think it's best if we part ways for now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_1">
		<text>Are you sure?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_2">
		<text>Yeah. You go do you. There is something I must deal with alone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_3">
		<text>Nah. Just pulling your leg.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="devushka_go_village_4">
		<text>Alright. I'll drop by the Rookie Village every now and then, so maybe I'll meet you there? Just, whatever you do, come back alive please.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="adventure_time_with_hip_0">
		<text>It's good to see you again Hip. Would you like to join me for another journey into the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="adventure_time_with_hip_1">
		<text>You only needed to ask.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="st_hip_news_1">
		<text>Hip: Alright, let's go to the village campfire then. Can't wait to hear it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_2">
		<text>Good luck on your mission, stalkers. Keep your wits about you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_3">
		<text>Hip: I wouldn't worry too much about the other job, I'm sure someone else is handling it by now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_4">
		<text>Beard seems pleased with his service, and this wasn't exactly the safest of courier jobs. Stay alive and this could be the start of a good business relationship.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_5">
		<text>Hip: Hey, guess you were right about getting in good with Barkeep first!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_6">
		<text>Hip: I know it isn't always easy doing something just out of the goodness of your heart.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_hip_news_7">
		<text>Hip: So really, thank you. You've probably helped make a world of difference for Yanov.</text>
