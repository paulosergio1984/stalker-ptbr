	<string id="guid_agr_mlr_military_1">
		<text>Yeah, I can take you to the Cordon and Yantar... Wait, who are you, even? I offer transport, but not for an ordinary soldier like you. Shoo.</text>

		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_1">
		<text>I serve as a medic. I went out on a contract here and was almost immediately assigned to the Fairway group, after some preparation. We were somehow stuck in Pripyat after the collapse of the operation - well, those of us who were still alive... then a man from the SSU helped us, and then they evacuated us. I still can't get this one case out of my head: our commander sent me and a couple of guys to the kindergarten, in which - according to preliminary data - there was a device that interfered with radio communications. I don't know what came over me, I wasn't feeling myself – I couldn't see, I didn't know where my comrades were, and something pulled a veil straight over my eyes. Right in that kindergarten, I found a damn refrigerator and hid there. Then, I heard an explosion right above me and I immediately felt better for whatever reason, but the refrigerator locked up and I couldn't get out without outside help. I don't recall if I locked myself in it or if it was a poltergeist that held the door closed...</text>

	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_2">
		<text>And then what happened? Why didn't you quit?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_3">
		<text>Well... I need the money, why would I have come back here otherwise? And doctors are always useful... However, there aren't a lot of them in the army at this point. Fortunately, though, I wasn't demoted for the failure of the operation, but I wasn't praised, either - unlike the major, who, by the way, is also hanging around somewhere here in the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="rogovets_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_4">
		<text>Understood. I wish you well on your travels.</text>

	<string id="rogovets_hello_1_6_army_mlr_0">

<!-- Commander, barman in Agroprom -->
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_1">
		<text>Well, I'm basically a local barman, or a manager of provisions... whichever you prefer. You could say that I'm one of the few who participated in cleaning up the accident at the nuclear power plant. I'm not exactly from here, but I decided to go to the Zone on contract. I've got some experience on me, hah.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_2">
		<text>How was it there?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="barmen_about_himself_1_6_army_mlr_3">
		<text>I was just an army draftee back then, only ever got to measure radioactivity and clean it up. However, the guys near the power station ended up waist-deep in shit. Even our technology died from the radiation, let alone the people... imagine that. So, they cleaned the roofs of graphite with freakin' shovels. Radiation is a strange thing - it curses some and spares others, like Dyatlov, who survived to end up in prison.</text>
